# 2-representations-of-webs

I collected a bit of Mathematica code relevant for the paper *On rank one 2-representations of web categories*
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04264">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04264</a> on this page.

The code is in a **.n** file that can be downloaded from this site and you can run it with Mathematica.

# Background

The paper *On rank one 2-representations of web categories* is actually about 2-representations, but for the actuall calculations 
(or to read this page) **we do not need to knowanything about 2-representations**. We rather recall some notions regarding matrices. Our main source for this is
the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2473">https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2473</a>.
